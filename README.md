React Todo App - Documentation

# 📝 React Todo App

A responsive and user-friendly Todo App built with **React**. It allows users to manage daily tasks with ease — add, update, complete, or delete todos. Data is persisted using **localStorage** so users won't lose their tasks on page reload.

## ✨ Features

-   ✅ Add new todos
-   ✏️ Edit and update existing todos
-   ❌ Delete todos
-   ✔️ Mark todos as completed
-   💾 Save todos to localStorage
-   🚫 Show empty state image when no todos exist
-   💻 Responsive and accessible UI

## 🔧 Technologies Used

-   React (with hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`)
-   JavaScript (ES6+)
-   HTML5 & CSS3
-   Font Awesome (for icons)
-   localStorage (for data persistence)
